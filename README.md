## Diwala frontpage
This was started with create-react-app, and is for now packed with the help for react-scripts. This can be ejected to get the webpack config and everything, but works for now.

## Develop
Run ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```    
This gets you a dev server, and watches everything.
PS: Css for now is kinda bad setup, so it might not be picked up when adding a new css file.

## Deploy
This runs on firebase. Ask me for permission.
So to deploy you have to do:   
```npm run build``` or ```yarn build```    
Then run:
```firebase deploy```
